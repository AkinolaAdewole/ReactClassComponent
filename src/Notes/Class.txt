Class in JavaScript is a blueprint way for creating objects that have the same properties and have access to the same method. 

In JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and later versions, you can create classes to define objects and their behavior using a more 
structured and object-oriented approach. The class syntax provides a cleaner and more familiar way to define constructor functions and 
prototype-based inheritance.

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Creating an object from the class
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);

// Calling the method on the object
person1.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
